python-based GUI for more easily cropping videos + some transcoding options

mainly written because I wanted a preview when cropping Shadowplay clips

You probably need ffmpeg in your path, haven't tested it without.

### Install requirements: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage:
Either run from the console: \
`python app.py <video_file>` \
or drag the file onto the script in your file browser
